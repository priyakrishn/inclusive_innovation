# inclusive_innovation
Inclusive Innovation is the process and product of collaborative solution-development. 
Innovation doesn’t just generate profits—it can also make the world a better place by 
addressing some of our most pressing development and humanitarian challenges. However,
the innovation process is complex and often excludes key stakeholders, intentionally 
or unintentionally, in how it is practiced.
